📊 Interpretation of Significant Results (p < 0.05)
➤ Unemployment → Industrial Production
p = 0.0000

Interpretation: Unemployment Granger-causes Industrial Production.

This means past values of unemployment help predict future industrial output.

➤ GDP → Industrial Production
p = 0.0073

Interpretation: GDP Granger-causes Industrial Production.

Past GDP has predictive power for future industrial output.

➤ CPI → Industrial Production
p = 0.0000

Interpretation: Consumer Price Index (CPI) Granger-causes Industrial Production.

Inflation trends can predict industrial growth patterns.

➤ Industrial Production → CPI
p = 0.0000

Interpretation: This is bidirectional causality.

Industrial activity also helps predict inflation.

➤ Unemployment → CPI
p = 0.0000

Suggests unemployment helps predict inflation, which aligns with economic theory (e.g., Phillips Curve).

➤ GDP → Unemployment
p = 0.0000

Suggests GDP growth can help forecast unemployment trends.

🚫 Non-significant Results (p ≥ 0.05)
For example:

CPI → GDP (p = 0.2616): CPI does not Granger-cause GDP — no strong evidence that inflation predicts GDP in your data.

🧠 What This Means Overall
Your results suggest:

GDP, Unemployment, and CPI have predictive power over Industrial Production.

There is a bidirectional causal relationship between Industrial Production and CPI.

Some expected economic relationships (like GDP → Unemployment) hold true in your data.
